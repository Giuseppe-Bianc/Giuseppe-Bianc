# ðŸ’« About Me

My name is Giuseppe Binaconi, and I am proud to be of Italian descent, specifically from the picturesque Basilicata region, renowned for its stunning landscapes and rich cultural heritage. I was born on April 9, 2001, in a small town nestled in the heart of Basilicata, a place that has profoundly shaped my values and outlook on life.<br><br>I am currently in my third year at the UniversitÃ  degli Studi della Basilicata (Unibas), where I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science within the esteemed Dimie Faculty. My academic journey at Unibas has been both challenging and rewarding, and it has equipped me with a solid foundation in computer science principles and practices.
